By utilizing the narrative, structural and graphic possibilities of the split- screen format, the story presented in this film is shaped, expanded, and complicated by way of associative editing and formal visual rhyming. With tenderness and longing, I hope to present not just a portrait of my grandmother, but also our own memories and stories — remembered, reconstructed, and retold.</p>",

The book delves into more personal stories: some took on the responsibility of an adult as a kid, translating at their grandpa’s doctor’s appointment. Some erased the pidgin accents they picked up in different countries. Some would pick up the phone in English at school even if it were from their family.

What is our relationship to memories when others see and remember us so differently from how we understand ourselves? And what is the value of consciously rewriting a memory? Memories slip and our subconscious changes them, making them into stories with their own lives.
